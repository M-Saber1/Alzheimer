# Alzheimer
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia, predominantly impacting the elderly and characterized by progressive cognitive decline. Early and precise detection is critical for effective management and improved patient outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods such as neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid analysis are often invasive, expensive, and time-consuming. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) provide promising alternatives that are non-invasive, efficient, and cost-effective. This study explores the application of various ML algorithms to predict Alzheimer's disease. The methodology involved data preprocessing and feature selection using the Spearman algorithm to enhance computational efficiency and model performance. We evaluated k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Trees (DT), and Ensemble methods. Results indicate that the Ensemble method achieved a predictive accuracy of 94.07% using only 13 features. These results demonstrate the potential of ML algorithms in revolutionizing AD diagnostics, offering scalable and accurate solutions for early detection.
