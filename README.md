Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major cause of dementia, primarily affecting older adults and leading to gradual cognitive decline. Early and accurate detection is essential for effective management and improved patient outcomes. Traditional diagnostic approaches, such as neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid analysis, can be invasive, costly, and time-consuming.

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) offer promising, non-invasive, efficient, and cost-effective alternatives for diagnosing AD. This study investigates the application of various ML algorithms to predict Alzheimer's disease, utilizing data preprocessing and feature selection through the Spearman algorithm to enhance computational efficiency and model performance.

The study evaluated several algorithms, including k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Trees (DT), and Ensemble methods. The results demonstrated that the Ensemble method achieved a remarkable predictive accuracy of 94.07% using only 13 features. These findings highlight the potential of ML algorithms to transform AD diagnostics, providing scalable and precise solutions for early detection.
